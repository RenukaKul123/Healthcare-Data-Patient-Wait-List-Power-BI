## Problem Statement

Keeping track of patient wait lists is a major difficulty for hospitals, for both inpatients (those admitted for treatment) and outpatients (those receiving treatment without hospital admission). Ineffective treatment of these wait lists may exacerbate patient dissatisfaction cause problems with resource distribution, and lower the standard of care provided by the medical community as a whole.

The hospital does not yet have a complete system in place to monitor and evaluate patient wait lists. A system that offers comprehensive historical trend analysis at the inpatient and outpatient levels, real-time tracking of the wait list's current state, and in-depth evaluation at the specialty and age profile levels is required.

The goal of this project is to use Power BI to develop interactive dashboards and visualizations in order to address these issues. We will offer useful insights into the average and median wait periods, the current total wait list, and other important indicators by examining data from 2018 to 2021. This will facilitate data-driven decision-making, streamline patient flow, and eventually raise the standard of care for hospital administration and medical personnel.
